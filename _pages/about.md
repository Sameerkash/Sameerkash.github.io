Hello! my current research interests are in applying Scientific Machine Learning and Explianbale AI to climate related research statments, I am also a Full Stack AI Software Engineer.

- Head [here](/cv) for my Curriculum vitae
- Head to [publications](/publications) for my latest and ongoing research work.

From my experience, I specialize in building cross-platform apps with Flutter and Backend applications with Node.js and Typescript, albeit, I have had the opportunity to gain exposure to multiple other tools and fields like Docker, K8s, GCP and AWS, and Backend Engineering. I've developed strong product thinking and engineering skills as well as developed intuition in building highly performant fluid user experiences, and my exploration and curiosity have enabled me to contribute to the emerging Web3 technology ecosystem and obtain credentials as a Blockchain developer. I'm currently on a mission to take on climate change and am deeply invested in exploring and building climate tech solutions.

I also do a lot of community work, create tech content and speak at events, I'm always looking out for opportunities to hear unique ideas and collaborate with amazing people, so please don't hesitate to send a DM, I'm open to chatting!
