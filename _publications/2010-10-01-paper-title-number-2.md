The remarkable ability of Large Language Models in generating text and natural language processing has transformed the productivity of industries making them suited for tasks like data interpretation and summarization. However, their inability to perform precise scientific calculations, particularly for tasks involving complex reasoning limits their reliability for scientific calculations that involve Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) and require precise numerical outputs. Scientific Machine Learning (SciML), on the other hand, excels at solving ODEs and Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). Integrating LLMs with SciML presents a bold vision, combining LLMsâ€™ accessibility with SciML brings in interpretability and precision as the relationship and casualty of inputs are predetermined, this offers a powerful solution for tackling complex scientific challenges. This integration could make sophisticated scientific modeling in domains such as weather forecasts, fluid dynamics, health care, and modeling more approachable results while maintaining the accuracy needed for reliable predictions and simulations. In this paper, we position how LLMs can be integrated with SciML by taking an example of COVID-19 as a critical problem which will provide opportunities for AI researchers to contribute towards mitigating challenges in safety-critical domains.
